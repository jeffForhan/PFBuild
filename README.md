A platformer game I built in Unity

Controls for platformer game:

move using the arrow keys or AWSD

turn by moving the mouse

Change camera elevation by moving mouse up or down

Once falling at a great enough velocity, the camera can move higher and adjusts faster

jump with space bar

Jumping to a platform allows a player to jump again.
Jumping, quickly, from platform to platform allows a player to traverse large gaps, or climb up to platforms too tall to be reached by a regular jump.
